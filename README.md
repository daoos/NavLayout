<img src="images/web.png" width="50"> | ***Websites / eCommerce*** : Why not changing conventional design layouts like search boxes always on top, fixed main menus / header / footer ... in my views everything should be responsive, floatable, dockable as per user choice.. Don't you think so ?  
<img src="images/admin.png" width="50"> | ***Admin Dashboard*** : Admin dashboards are complex so why not giving user some gui flexibility to arrange his layout like menu, widgets...
